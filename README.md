# How to run
To run the program, extract the zip file to xampp -> htdocs so that there will be a folder called "SpaceLego-main" in the htdocs.
First, turn on the xampp server and get into the myPHP database ("localhost/phpmyadmin" on a browser) 
and import the following sql files in order (products.sql -> accounts.sql -> cart.sql).
Then, (preferably Google Chrome) type in the following: "localhost/SpaceLego-main/php/index.php".
You will then be able to navigate our website. Enjoy our products!
